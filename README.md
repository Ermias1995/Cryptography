# Cryptography
This project is build using JAVA programing Language and using three known symmetric encryption algorithm. These three Algorithms are the following...

1. One-Time Pad: The One-Time Pad is also known as the Vernam Cipher or the Perfect Cipher. It is an encryption technique that uses a random and secret key of the same length as the plaintext. The key is truly random and should only be used once. The encryption is performed by combining the plaintext with the key using a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. One-Time Pad is considered to be theoretically unbreakable if used correctly, as it provides perfect secrecy. However, practical implementation and key management can be challenging.

2. 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard): It is also known as TDES or Triple DES. 3DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher three times to each data block. It is called "Triple" because it uses three different keys in the encryption process. 3DES enhances the security of the original DES algorithm by providing a larger key size and more iterations. It is widely used in legacy systems and some specific applications.

3. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that has become the most widely used encryption standard. It was selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a replacement for the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. It provides a high level of security, efficiency, and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including securing data transmission, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring confidentiality in various systems.

By the way in this project I only make the Graphical User Interface for these Algorithms...
